🎲 Pig Dice Game (Tkinter)
A simple implementation of the classic Pig Dice Game using Python and Tkinter for the GUI.
The game is designed for two players who take turns rolling a die.

🕹️ How to Play
Each player takes turns rolling a single die.
On your turn, you can roll or hold:

🎲 Roll:
If you roll 2–6, the value is added to your turn score.
If you roll a 1, you lose all points from the current turn, and it becomes the other player’s turn.

✋ Hold:
Add your turn score to your total score.
Pass the turn to the other player.
The first player to reach 100 points wins! 🎉
